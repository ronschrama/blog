# Ron Schrama blog

This blog is based on the egghead Gatsby starter kit https://github.com/eggheadio/gatsby-starter-egghead-blog It's my current blog setup to quickly start blogging. I refactored it to my own designs and liking and will keep altering it as a learning project. But the goal was to quickly build a blog build with Gatsby with Markdown which this kit provided.

## Future plans
Once I got everything up and running I will start developing my own blog from the ground up.
